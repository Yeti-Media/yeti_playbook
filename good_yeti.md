## Team Communication

### Be available
We don't expect you to be chained to your desk, but we do expect a reasonably consistent schedule - a predictable number of hours per week, and a reasonably consistency in when you'll be working during the day.

Make sure we know your general availability - how many hours a week you can work. If that changes, 'cause you're starting school, or opening an alligator farm for the summer, let us know.

Mondays, let us know your availability for the week ahead. That'll hopefully be the same every week, it's just a way to make sure we know what to expect.

If you're taking days off, give us two weeks notice. We're making commitments to clients about resource availability, which we need to be able to keep.

If you're stepping away during normal working hours, please post a note in the Slack, along the lines of "lunch, back in an hour" or "picking up kids, back at 7".

### Keep commitments
If you take a task but get stuck, ask for help after 20-30 minutes of no progress. It's not giving up, it's keeping the wheels moving and taking advantage of being on a team.
If you take a task but can't deliver when expected due to time off, hardware or other reasons, let us know immediately so we can reassign.

#### Talk
Most of this just comes down to communication. Since we can't walk around to your cubicle to see if you're there and ask for your TPS reports, if we can't reach you online you become invisible. 

We need to know when you're working, when you're not working, and how things are going on your tasks and commitments. It's not really a big deal - just a few words in Slack to keep in touch throughout the day will help enormously.

### Learn
We should all be learning, all the time. Try to keep a steady diet of screencasts, books, and experiments going. If you find something good, let us know so we can all dig in.

### Coding standards
Our main selling point as a company is that we write quality code. So, please do. We should all be continuously pushing ourselves to write better, cleaner, better-tested code. We'll be compiling a style guide; feel free to submit suggestions.
