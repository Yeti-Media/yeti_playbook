# Point estimations
#### Story points rate the relative effort of work
This may sound counter-intuitive, but that abstraction is actually helpful because it pushes the team to make tougher decisions around the difficulty of work.

- 0 (trivial issue)
- 0.5
- 1
- 2
- 4
- 8 (We should break this into smaller estimates.)

# Tip:
Keep estimations high level. If the team is too far into the weeds, take a breath, and up-level the discussion
